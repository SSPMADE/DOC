<h1>Machine Learning Data</h1>

Up to 80% of a Machine Learning project is about Collecting Data:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>What data is Required?</li>
                    <li>What data is Available?</li>
                    <li>How to Select the data?</li>
                    <li>How to Collect the data?</li>
                    <li>How to Clean the data?</li>
                    <li>How to Prepare the data?</li>
                    <li>How to Use the data?</li>
                </ul>

<h1>What is Data?</h1>
Data can be many things.<br>
With Machine Learning, data is collections of facts:<br>

<table width="200" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>Examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Numbers	Prices.</td>
      <td>Dates.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Measurements</td>
      <td>Size. Height. Weight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Words</td>
      <td>Names and Places.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Observations</td>
      <td>Counting Cars.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Descriptions</td>
      <td>It is cold.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Intelligence Needs Data<br>
Human intelligence needs data:<br>
A real estate broker needs data about sold houses to estimate prices.<br>

Artificial Intelligence also needs data:<br>

A Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.<br>

Data can help us to see and understand.<br>

Data can help us to find new opportunities.<br>

Data can help us to resolve misunderstandings.<br>

Healthcare<br>
Healthcare and life sciences collect public health data and patient data to learn how to improve patient care and save lives.<br>

Business<br>
The most successful companies in many sectors are data driven. They use sophisticated data analytics to learn how the company can perform better.<br>

Finance<br>
Banks and insurance companies collect and evaluate data about customers, loans and deposits to support strategic decision-making.<br>

Storing Data<br>
The most common data to collect are Numbers and Measurements.<br>

Often data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values.<br>

This table contains house prices versus size:<br>

Price	7	8	8	9	9	9	10	11	14	14	15<br>
Size	50	60	70	80	90	100	110	120	130	140	150<br>
Quantitative vs. Qualitative<br>
Quantitative data are numerical:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>55 cars</li>
                    <li>15 meters</li>
                    <li>35 children</li>
                </ul>
Qualitative data are descriptive:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is cold</li>
                    <li>It is long</li>
                    <li>It was fun</li>
                </ul>
Census or Sampling<br>
A Census is when we collect data for every member of a group.<br>

A Sample is when we collect data for some members of a group.<br>

If we wanted to know how many Americans smoke cigarettes, we could ask every person in the US (a census), or we could ask 10 000 people (a sample).<br>

A census is Accurate, but hard to do. A sample is Inaccurate, but is easier to do.<br>

Sampling Terms<br>
A Population is group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information from.<br>

A Census is information about every individual in a population.<br>

A Sample is information about a part of the population (In order to represent all).<br>

Random Samples<br>
In order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly.<br>

A Random Sample, is a sample where every member of the population has an equal chance to appear in the sample.<br>

Sampling Bias<br>
A Sampling Bias (Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way that some individuals are less (or more) likely to be included in the sample.<br>

Big Data<br>
Big data is data that is impossible for humans to process without the assistance of advanced machines.<br>

Big data does not have any definition in terms of size, but datasets are becoming larger and larger as we continously collect more and more data and store data at a lower and lower cost.<br>

Data Mining<br>
With big data comes complicated data structures.<br>

A huge part of big data processing is refining data.<br>
