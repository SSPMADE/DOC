<h1>Deep Learning (DL)</h1>
The deep learning revolution started around 2010.<br>

Since then, Deep Learning has solved many "unsolvable" problems.<br>

The deep learning revolution was not started by a single discovery. It more or less happened when several needed factors were ready:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Computers were fast enough</li>
                    <li>Computer storage was big enough</li>
                    <li>Better training methods were invented</li>
                    <li>Better tuning methods were invented</li>
                </ul>
Neurons<br>
Scientists agree that our brain has between 80 and 100 billion neurons.<br>

These neurons have hundreds of billions connections between them.<br>

Neurons (aka Nerve Cells) are the fundamental units of our brain and nervous system.<br>

The neurons are responsible for receiving input from the external world, for sending output (commands to our muscles), and for transforming the electrical signals in between.<br>

Neural Networks<br><br>
Artificial Neural Networks are normally called Neural Networks (NN).<br>

Neural networks are in fact multi-layer Perceptrons.<br>

The perceptron defines the first step into multi-layered neural networks.<br>

Neural Networks are the essence of Deep Learning.<br>

Neural Networks are one of the most significant discoveries in history.<br>

Neural Networks can solve problems that can NOT be solved by algorithms:<br>

Medical Diagnosis<br>
Face Detection<br>
Voice Recognition<br>
The Neural Network Model<br>
Input data (Yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (Blue) and modified against another hidden layer (Green) to produce the final output (Red).

Tom Mitchell<br>
Tom Michael Mitchell (born 1951) is an American computer scientist and University Professor at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).<br>

He is a former Chair of the Machine Learning Department at CMU.<br>

"A computer program is said to lea<br><br>rn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."<br>

Tom Mitchell (1999)<br>

E: Experience (the number of times).<br>
T: The Task (driving a car).<br>
P: The Performance (good or bad).<br>

The Giraffe Story<br>
In 2015, Matthew Lai, a student at Imperial College in London created a neural network called Giraffe.<br>

Giraffe could be trained in 72 hours to play chess at the same level as an international master.<br>

Computers playing chess are not new, but the way this program was created was new.<br>

Smart chess playing programs take years to build, while Giraffe was built in 72 hours with a neural network.<br>

Deep Learning<br>
Classical programming uses programs (algorithms) to create results:<br>

Traditional Computing<br>
Data + Computer Algorithm = Result<br>

Machine Learning uses results to create programs (algorithms):<br><br>

Machine Learning<br>
Data + Result = Computer Algorithm<br>

Machine Learning<br><br>
Machine Learning is often considered equivalent with Artificial Intelligence.<br>

This is not correct. Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.<br>

Machine Learning is a discipline of AI that uses data to teach machines.<br>

"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed."<br>

Arthur Samuel (1959)<br><br>

Intelligent Decision Formula<br>
Save the result of all actions<br>
Simulate all possible outcomes<br>
Compare the new action with the old ones<br>
Check if the new action is good or bad<br>
Choose the new action if it is less bad<br>
Do it all over again<br>
The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can make very intelligent decisions.
