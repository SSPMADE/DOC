<h1>Machine Learning</h1>

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial intelligence<br>

"Learning machines to imitate human intelligence"<br>

<br>

Machine Learning (ML)<br>
Traditional programming uses algorithms to produce results from data:<br>

Data + Algorithms = Results<br>

Machine learning creates algorithms from data and results:<br>

Data + Results = Algorithms<br>

Neural Networks (NN)<br>
Neural Networks is:<br>
<br>
A programming technique<br>
A method used in machine learning<br>
A software that learns from mistakes<br>
Neural Networks are based on how the human brain works:<br>
Neurons are sending messages to each other. While the neurons are trying to solve a problem (over and over again), it is strengthening the connections that lead to success and diminishing the connections that lead to failure.

Perceptrons<br>
The Perceptron defines the first step into Neural Networks.<br>

It represents a single neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

Neural Networks<br>
Neural Networks are Multi-Layer Perceptrons.<br>

<br>
Neural Networks<br>
In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:<br>

An input layer (yellow)<br>
A hidden layer (blue)<br>
An output layer (red)<br>
In the Neural Network Model, input data (yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (blue) before producing the final output (red).

The First Layer:<br>
The yellow perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input. Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.
<br>
The Second Layer:<br>
The blue perceptrons are making decisions by weighing the results from the first layer. This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.
<br>
<br>
Deep Neural Networks<br>
Deep Neural Networks are made up of several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on massive amounts of data.
<br>
Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.
<br>
For instance, optical reading uses low layers to identify edges, and higher layers to identify letters.

<br>
Neural Networks<br>
In the Deep Neural Network Model, input data (yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (blue) and modified against more hidden layers (green) to produce the final output (red).
<br>
The First Layer:
The yellow perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input. Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.
<br>
The Second Layer:
The blue perceptrons are making decisions by weighing the results from the first layer. This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.
<br>
The Third Layer:
Even more complex decisions are made by the green perceptrons.
<br>
Deep Learning (DL)<br>
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.<br>

Deep Learning is responsible for the AI boom of the last years.<br>

Deep learning is an advanced type of ML that handles complex tasks like image recognition.<br>
