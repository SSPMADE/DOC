<h1>Machine Learning Languages</h1>

Programming languages involved in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are:<br>

LISP<br>
R<br>
Python<br>
C++<br>
Java<br>
JavaScript<br>
SQL<br>
LISP<br>
LISP is the second oldest programming language in the world (1958), one year younger than Fortran (1957).<br>

The term Artificial Intelligence was made up by John McCarthy who invented LISP.<br>

LISP was founded on the theory of Recursive Functions (self modifying functions), and this is very suitable for Machine Learning programs where "self-learning" is an important part of the program.<br>


<br>
The R Language<br>
R is a programming language for Graphics and Statistical computing.<br>

R is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.<br>

R comes with a wide set of statistical and graphical techniques for:<br>

Linear Modeling<br>
Nonlinear Modeling<br>
Statistical Tests<br>
Time-series Analysis<br>
Classification<br>
Clustering<br>
<br>
Python<br>
Python is a general-purpose coding language. It can be used for all types of programming and software development.<br>

Python is typically used for server development, like building web apps for web servers.<br>

Python is also typically used in Data Science.<br>

An advantage for using Python is that it comes with some very suitable libraries:<br>

NumPy (Library for working with Arrays)<br>
SciPy (Library for Statistical Science)<br>
Matplotlib (Graph Plotting Library)<br>
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)<br>
TensorFlow (Machine Learning)<br>

C++<br>
C++ holds the title: "The worlds fastest programming language".<br>

Because of the speed, C++ is a preferred language when programming Computer Games.<br>

It provides faster execution and has less response time which is applied in search engines and development of computer games.<br>

Google uses C++ in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programs for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).<br>

SHARK is a super-fast C++ library with support for supervised learning algorithms, linear regression, neural networks, and clustering.<br>

MLPACK is also a super-fast machine learning library for C++.<br><br>

Java<br><br>
Java is another general-purpose coding language that can be used for all types of software development.<br>

For Machine Learning, Java is mostly used to create algorithms, and neural networks.<br><br>

SQL<br>
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for managing data.<br>

Knowledge of SQL databases, tables and queries helps data scientists when dealing with data.<br>

SQL is very convenient for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.<br>
