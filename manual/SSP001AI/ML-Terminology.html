<h1>ML Terminology</h1>

Relationships<br>
Labels<br>
Features<br><br>
Machine Learning Relationships<br>
Machine learning systems uses Relationships between Inputs to produce Predictions.<br><br>

In algebra, a relationship is often written as y = ax + b:<br>

y is the label we want to predict<br>
a is the slope of the line<br>
x are the input values<br>
b is the intercept<br>
With ML, a relationship is written as y = b + wx:<br>

y is the label we want to predict<br>
w is the weight (the slope)<br>
x are the features (input values)<br>
b is the intercept<br>
Machine Learning Labels<br>
In Machine Learning terminology, the label is the thing we want to predict.<br>

It is like the y in a linear graph:<br>

Algebra	Machine Learning<br>
y = ax + b	y = b + wx<br>
Machine Learning Features<br>
In Machine Learning terminology, the features are the input.<br>

They are like the x values in a linear graph:<br>

Algebra	Machine Learning<br>
y = ax + b	y = b + wx<br>
Sometimes there can be many features (input values) with different weights:<br>

y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4<br>

Machine Learning Models<br>
Machine Learning Training<br>
Machine Learning Inference<br>
Machine Learning Phases<br>
Machine Learning Models<br>
A Model defines the relationship between the label (y) and the features (x).<br>

There are three phases in the life of a model:<br>

Data Collection<br>
Training<br><br>
Inference<br><br>
Machine Learning Training<br><br>
The goal of training is to create a model that can answer a question. Like what is the expected price for a house?<br><br>

Machine Learning Inference<br><br>
Inference is when the trained model is used to infer (predict) values using live data. Like putting the model into production.<br><br>

Machine Learning Phases<br><br>
Machine learning has two main phases:<br><br>

1. Training:<br><br>
Input data are used to calculate the parameters of the model.<br><br>

2. Inference:<br><br>
The "trained" model outputs correct data from any input.<br><br>

Supervised Machine Learning<br><br>
Unsupervised Machine Learning<br><br>
Self-Supervised Machine Learning<br><br>
Supervised Learning<br><br>
Supervised Machine Learning uses a set of input variables to predict the value of an output variable.<br><br>

Supervised learning uses labeled data (data with known answers) to train algorithms to:<br><br>

Classify Data<br><br>
Predict Outcomes<br><br>
Supervised learning can classify data like "What is spam in an e-mail", based on known spam examples.<br><br>

Supervised learning can predict outcomes like predicting what kind of video you like, based on the videos you have played.<br>

Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning uses patterns from any unlabeled dataset, trying to understand patterns (or groupings) in the data.<br>

Unsupervised learning is used to predict undefined relationships like meaningful patterns in data.<br>

It is about creating computer algorithms than can improve themselves.<br>

It is expected that machine learning will shift to unsupervised learning to allow programmers to solve problems without creating models.<br>

Reinforcement Learning<br>
Reinforcement learning is based on non-supervised learning but receives feedback from the user whether the decision is good or bad. The feedback <br>contributes to improving the model.<br>

Self-Supervised Learning<br>
Self-supervised learning is similar to unsupervised learning because it works with data without human added labels.<br>

The difference is that unsupervised learning uses clustering, grouping, and dimensionality reduction, while self-supervised learning draw its own conclusions for regression and classification tasks.<br>
