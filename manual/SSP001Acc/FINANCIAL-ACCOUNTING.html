<h3>Book-keeping Versus Accounting:</h3>
What is the difference between bookkeeping and accounting?
<br />There is some confusion over the difference between bookkeeping and accounting. This is due to the fact that two are related and there is no universal accepted line of demarcation between them.
<br />Generally bookkeeping is the art of recording of all business data/transactions in the prescribed or acceptable manner for easy reporting and understanding. The work of a bookkeeper is of the clerical in nature. Accounting is primarily the science and art of recording, summarizing, classification, interpretation and the preparation of reports. Accountants often direct and review the work of bookkeepers.  Accounting is the language employed to communicate financial information of a concern to such parties.
<br />The work book or books mean books of accounts and keeping implies maintaining in proper form and order. Thus bookkeeping may be defined as the art of recording business transactions in books in a regular and systematic manner. It has been defined by different experts as:
<ol>
  <li>"The science and art of correctly recording in books of accounts all those business transactions that result in the transfer of money's worth." </li>
  <li>"The art and science of recording business transactions in such a systematic way as a trader may know the result of his trade at the end of a certain period and may also prove the accuracy of such record." </li>
  <li>"The science and art of correctly recording business dealings in a set of books with a view to having a permanent record of transactions and the financial result thereof." </li>
</ol>
It should be noted from the above definitions that bookkeeping primarily deals in the art of recording transactions in books.
<br />Accounting is defined as the art of recording, classifying, summarizing and classifying all business transactions expressed in monetary terms to enable  the preparation of reports and interpretation of reports.
