<h1>[name]</h1>
The style of the text on your web pages is very important to the overall design of your website. You will want the text style to meet your needs. There are physical type styles that you can use when formatting characters. The following is a list of the most popular physical type styles:<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; <strong>Bold Text</strong> &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;I&gt; <em>Italic Text</em> &lt;/I&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;TT&gt; Fixed width font &lt;/TT&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;U&gt; <u>Underline Text</u> &lt;/U&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;SUB&gt; Subscript &lt;/SUB&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;SUP&gt; Superscript &lt;/SUP&gt;<br>
<br>
You can also change the font of the characters. The default font type for HTML documents is Times New Roman. I personally don't like that font type so I designated arial as the base font type for my website. The &lt;FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; tags can be used with the FACE, SIZE, and COLOR attributes to change the font type of characters to be displayed by the web browser. FACE must equal the name of the font, such as FONT="arial". SIZE must equal the size of the characters in points (PT), such as SIZE=2pt. COLOR must equal the hexadecimal color value of the characters, such as COLOR=#000000. For example,<br>
<br>
    
&lt;FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=4PT COLOR=#000080&gt;"The Programmer's Domain"&lt;/FONT&gt;, would produce the following:<br>
<br>
    
"The Programmer's Domain"<br>
<br>
<em>Example sizes of the point size values from 1 to 7:</em><br>
<br>
1PT : 1 point arial type text<br>
2PT : 2 point arial type text<br>
3PT : 3 point arial type text<br>
4PT : 4 point arial type text<br>
5PT : 5 point arial type text<br>
6PT : 6 point arial type text<br>
7PT : 7 point arial type text<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: In order for your specfied font to override the default font displayed by a web browser, the visitor to your site must have your specified font saved on his computer. For example, if I chose to use the font type <em>ocra</em> as the font type for text on one of my web pages, the visitor to my web page must have the <em>ocra</em> font on his computer; otherwise, he will see the default font type.<br>
<br>
That's all I want to say about formatting characters with HTML. You may not realize it right now, but later when you are experimenting for the perfect look for your website, character formatting and styles will be very important in satisfying your needs. The next section will show you how to organize your information through various lists.
