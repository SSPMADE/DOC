<h1>[name]</h1>
As I have mentioned before, you can easily add life to your web pages by adding creative images and visuals. 
Most people prefer looking at informative pictures and images rather than reading nothing but text. If you 
are wondering why I haven't included any images in this tutorial, well, it's becuase it is a tutorial. 
A tutorial is supposed to be informative, and it's not meant for people to look at, it's meant for them to 
read. Some people may want to print some of these articles, and I don't want them to waste a bunch of ink 
on irrelevant images. You should add images and life to the overall layout of your website.
<br>
<br>
Most web browsers can display images in the GIF and JPEG format, but with new browser capabilites constantly 
arising, more file formats are capable of being displayed. To include an image in a web page document, enter:

<code>&lt;IMG SRC=""&gt;</code>

where the full path of the image is placed between the quotes. For example, if you had an image named 
logo.gif in your web directory, use<br>

<code>&lt;IMG SRC="logo.gif"&gt;</code>

You can use WIDTH="" and HEIGHT="" attributes to specify the width and height of the image. Some say this 
allows for faster loading times, but I have never confirmed it. It simply lets the browser allocate space 
on the web page for the image. For example,<br>

<code>&lt;IMG SRC="logo.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="100"&gt;</code>

Because some browsers cannot display certain image formats and some people choose to turn off all image 
loading, you should also use the ALT="" attribute to inform the visitor of which type of graphic would 
be displayed. The text is displayed instead of the image only if the browser will not load the image. For example,

<code>&lt;IMG SRC="logo.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="100" ALT="The Company Logo"&gt;</code>
