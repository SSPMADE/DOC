Book-keeping Versus Accounting:
What is the difference between bookkeeping and accounting?
There is some confusion over the difference between bookkeeping and accounting. This is due to the fact that two are related and there is no universal accepted line of demarcation between them.
Generally bookkeeping is the art of recording of all business data/transactions in the prescribed or acceptable manner for easy reporting and understanding. The work of a bookkeeper is of the clerical in nature. Accounting is primarily the science and art of recording, summarizing, classification, interpretation and the preparation of reports. Accountants often direct and review the work of bookkeepers.  Accounting is the language employed to communicate financial information of a concern to such parties.
The work book or books mean books of accounts and keeping implies maintaining in proper form and order. Thus bookkeeping may be defined as the art of recording business transactions in books in a regular and systematic manner.
