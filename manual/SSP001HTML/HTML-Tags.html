<h1>[name]</h1><br>
HTML uses tags, the more tags you know, the better you will be able to customize your web pages.<br>
HTML tags contain a left angle bracket ( &lt; ), a tag name, and a right angle bracket ( &gt; ).<br>
Tags normally have a start and end tag. The end tag is identical to the start tag with a backslash ( / ) preceding the text between the brackets.<br>
Some elements may include additional instructions in the start tag, called attributes. Attributes give additional information about the element to the web browser.<br>
<br><u>The Basic HTML Tags:</u><br>
<br>
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;<br>
This element simply notifies the web browser that this document contains HTML-coded information. This is also indicated by the .html or .htm extension.<br>
<br>
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
This element identifies the beginning of your HTML document. It contains the title tag and could possibly contain other scripting language code such as Java, Javascript, style sheets, etc.<br>
<br>
&lt;TITLE&gt;&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br>
This element specifies the text to be displayed in the title bar of the web browser. The title is not displayed within the content area of the broswer. You should make the title of your site very descriptive and meaningful because it is what is used if someone bookmarks your site.<br>
<br>
&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
This element contains the content of your document that is to be displayed in the content area of a web browser.<br>
<br>
<u>Other Useful Tags:</u>Â [used in the body of your document]<br>
<br>
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;<br>
Even though the center tag is very basic and extremely easy to understand, it can be very useful in a document. Everything placed between the start and end center tags will be centered on the screen.<br>
<br>
Text Headings &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; through &lt;H6&gt;&lt;/H6&gt;<br>
HTML has six levels of text form heading, from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most prominent (biggest) level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>&lt;h1&gt;H1 Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</h1>
<h2>&lt;h2&gt;H2 Heading&lt;/h2&gt;</h2>
<h3>&lt;h3&gt;H3 Heading&lt;/h3&gt;</h3>
<h4>&lt;h4&gt;H4 Heading&lt;/h4&gt;</h4>
<h5>&lt;h5&gt;H5 Heading&lt;/h5&gt;</h5>
<h6>&lt;h6&gt;H6 Heading&lt;/h6&gt;</h6>
<br>
<br>
&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;<br>
This is the preformatted text tag. Unlike word processing documents, word wrapping is default (unless otherwise instructed) in a HTML document and multiple spaces are reduced to one single space. This tag makes spaces, line breaks, and tabs appear in the same location as it does in the source file document. The pre tag can also be used with the WIDTH="#" attribute to specify how many characters are displayed on each line.<br>
<br>
&lt;HR&gt;<br>
This tag produces a horizontal rule that extends across the content area in a web browser. It is useful for seperating and organizing information. An alternative and better idea would be to create an image of your own that matches your site that will serve the same purpose. You can use two attributes with this tag. The SIZE attribute specifies the line thickness in pixels. The WIDTH attribute specifies the line width in percentage of the screen or the line width in pixel values. For example, &lt;HR WIDTH=1 SIZE=450&gt; produces the following:<br>
<br>
<hr width="450" size="5">
<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Using this tag causes a line to break with no extra space. It is the same as pressing enter in a word processing document; it simply breaks the line and begins a new one.<br>
<br>
You now have enough knowledge about HTML to produce a web page with formatted text. Next is an introducction to forms.
