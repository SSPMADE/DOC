<h1>[name]</h1>
A hyperlink is text or an image in a HTML document that can be clicked on in order to gain access to an external website, an internal web page, an external web page, or internal sections within an HTML document. An external link takes you to another website that is not part of your original website, such as going to YAHOO from my site. An internal link is a link that takes you to another web page which is apart of your original website, such as going to PART 9 of this tutorial from this web page. An external web page link takes you to a web page that is apart of another website. Internal section links point to areas within a web page document, such as the Jump To Article link at the top of this web page or the Back to Top link at the bottom.<br>
<br>
Hyperlinks are easily noticed in a web page document because if you move your mouse over the link, your mouse pointer should change to a hand with the index finger pointing to the link, which indicates that you may click on the text or image. By default, text hyperlinks are underlined and painted color blue. Image hyperlinks are given a distinct border color. You can change the color of links, visited links, and active links by using the following attributes of the &lt;BODY&gt; tag:<br>
<br>
LINK="Hyperlink color"<br>
VLINK="Visited Hyperlink color"<br>
ALINK="Active Hyperlink color"<br>
<br>
You must use the hexadecimal HTML value of the color you wish to use as usual. If you want to remove the border surrounding an image hyperlink, use the BORDER="0" attribute of the image tag.<br>
<br>
The link tag is as follows: &lt;A HREF=""&gt;&lt;/A&gt;<br>
The url (full path) of the destination is to be placed between the quotes. The TARGET="_BLANK" attribute will allow the link to open the document in a new browser window so the visitor will not leave the current web page.<br>
<br>
